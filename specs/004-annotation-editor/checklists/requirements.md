- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All 9 user stories cover the complete annotation workflow from basic tools to advanced features
- 19 functional requirements cover all annotation tools, undo/redo, export, and UI interactions
- 8 success criteria provide measurable outcomes for performance and usability validation
- Prerequisite: Milestone 3 (Quick Access Overlay) must be completed first, as the annotation editor is opened from the Quick Access thumbnail
